# clinicApp
This is a full-stack Clinic Management System designed to streamline operations for clinics and healthcare facilities. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it focuses on real-world workflows, role-based access, and secure data management.

The system supports multiple user roles: Doctors, Nurses, and Admins, each with tailored permissions to ensure data security and operational efficiency. Doctors can create diagnoses, manage medical records, and approve treatments, while nurses can record patient vitals and assist with appointments. Admins manage users and monitor clinic activities.

This project emphasizes backend architecture, database design, and system-level thinking over flashy UI design. It’s intended to demonstrate problem-solving skills and the ability to develop functional, real-world systems that address critical workflow challenges in healthcare.
